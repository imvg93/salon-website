💇‍♀️ **Catwalk Salon & Academy Website**


I created this website as a **full-stack web development project** to represent a real-world business—Catwalk Salon & Academy, our professional salon and beauty training center. This project allowed me to apply and strengthen my skills in **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and Resend**, while building a clean, responsive, and fully functional website from _scratch_.

This website is designed to provide an engaging and smooth experience for both clients and students. From showcasing services and beauty training courses to enabling online bookings and real-time inquiries, it reflects both the technical and aesthetic aspects of modern web design.

**🔨 My Role & Tech Stack**
**Built the entire frontend using Next.js with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for smooth animations.**

**Integrated a booking form connected to Supabase for storing client info.**

**Set up email automation via Resend to handle form responses.**

**Designed a custom floating chatbox with a dark theme for better engagement.**

**Deployed the site using Vercel for global performance and speed.**
